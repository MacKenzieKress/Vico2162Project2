            These are portraits of my best friends from West Virgina, both taken by me. The first photo, Olivia, has been my best friend since elementary school. Her friendship is really special to me because we went to different high schools and still remained extremely close friends. The second photo, Logan, is my other closest friend. He is two years older than Olivia and I, but you'd never know. We are three peas in a pod. I chose these photos because I took them and their friendship means a lot to me. We have the same sense of humor and many of the same interests.
